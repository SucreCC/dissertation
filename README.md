For a Master's dissertation in sciences and engineering, the structure typically follows a specific format that emphasizes technical detail and experimental results. Here is a general outline with suggested components and word counts based on common practices in these fields:

1. **Title Page**:
   - No word count. Includes the dissertation title, your name, program details, and date.

2. **Abstract**:
   - Approximately 150-300 words. Summarizes the research topic, methods, main findings, and conclusions.

3. **Acknowledgements** (optional):
   - Usually under 300 words. Thanks those who assisted with the dissertation.

4. **Table of Contents**:
   - Not included in the word count. Lists all chapters and sections with page numbers.

5. **List of Figures and Tables**:
   - Not included in the word count. Enumerates all figures and tables used in the document.

6. **Introduction**:
   - About 1,000-2,000 words. Sets up the research question, importance of the work, and an overview of the dissertation's structure.

7. **Literature Review**:
   - Typically 3,000-4,000 words. Reviews existing research relevant to the thesis question and establishes the foundation for the research.

8. **Methodology**:
   - Around 2,000-3,000 words. Details the experimental, computational, or theoretical methods used to gather and analyze data.

9. **Results**:
   - Typically 3,000-4,000 words. Presents the data collected during research, usually supplemented by tables, graphs, and charts.

10. **Discussion**:
    - About 2,000-3,000 words. Interprets the results, explaining how they answer the research questions and relate to the hypothesis.

11. **Conclusion**:
    - Approximately 1,000-1,500 words. Summarizes the findings, discusses the implications of the results, limitations of the study, and possible future research directions.

12. **References/Bibliography**:
    - No word count. Lists all the academic sources referenced throughout the dissertation.

13. **Appendices**:
    - No word count. Includes supplementary material like raw data, additional experimental details, or software code.

The total word count for a Master's dissertation in sciences and engineering usually ranges from 20,000 to 40,000 words, depending on the complexity of the topic and the specific requirements of the academic department. Always check your specific program guidelines for detailed requirements regarding the structure and length of your dissertation.
